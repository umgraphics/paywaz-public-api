# Paywaz Public API (Preview)

Welcome to the **Paywaz Public API** — the developer gateway into our zero-fee, crypto-native payments infrastructure.

Paywaz runs on **Solana Mainnet**, leveraging high-speed, low-cost settlement rails while providing an API-first architecture for merchants, enterprises, and global platforms.

> **Note:** This is a public preview. Additional endpoints, SDKs, and documentation will be released as Paywaz transitions out of stealth.
